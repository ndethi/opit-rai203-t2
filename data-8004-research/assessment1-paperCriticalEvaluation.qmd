  This paper presents a critical evaluation of Abbott and Martinus's (2020) research on participatory methods for low-resource machine translation, specifically focusing on African languages. The evaluation employs the CRAAP framework to assess the currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, and purpose of the research. Furthermore, it reflects on the note-taking methodology used, provides a summary of the paper, and offers a critical reflection on the strengths and limitations of the participatory approach. The analysis connects the paper's findings to broader African NLP initiatives and the author's research interests in low-resource language preservation.

## 1. Introduction
My interest in the paper "Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation" by Abbott and Martinus (2020) stems from a curiosity about how technology specifically Machine Translation could be used to promote uptake of learning and speaking of Kikuyu, my mothertongue and by all measure a low-resourced language, amongst the younger generation of that community while leveraging collaborative creation of annotatable datasets from the older generation who speak it better. 
The paper's focus on participatory research methods for low-resource machine translation aligns with my research interest in collaboratively developing datasets for low-resourced languages through crowd-sourcing and community engagement. 
A discussion of broader NLP initiatives particularly in Africa through the Masakhane Community adds to the relevance of the paper in the context of my research goals.
