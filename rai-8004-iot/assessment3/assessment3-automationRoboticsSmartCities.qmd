# Exercise 1: Automation and Robotics {#sec-exercise1}

## Introduction {#sec-intro1}

Jensen Huang, Nvidia's C.EO in recent times has positioned physical ai as the next frontier of AI that we ought to pay close attention to. Physical ai here making reference to the robotics ecosystem his company looks to support. In fact releasing N-Groot as an open source tool further cements Nvidias commitment to collaboratively furthering this robotics narrative in  a novel way (often other players have closed-source such platforms stifling collaborative innovation). While this is no outright endorsement 

## Task 1: Fundamentals of Automation & Testing Methodologies {#sec-task1-1}

### Automation Foundations {#sec-automation-foundations}

Automation makes reference to the implementation of technologies towards perfomance of tasks with minimal human intervention. Automation could be categorized into three basic buckets.

* **Basic Automation**: Simple rule-based systems executing predefined tasks
* **Process Automation**: End-to-end workflows integrating digital transactions with mechanical systems
* **Intelligent Automation**: AI-enhanced systems capable of learning and adapting to changing conditions

The ecosystem of automation systems comprises a combination of interconnected components including sensors, controllers, software interfaces, communication networks, and human-machine interfaces (HMI), all working together to enable autonomous operation [@AutomationDaily]. This architecture has two broad primary areas of implementation: 

#### Enterprsise / Industry
In industrial application, automation boosts overall plant / factory productivity by handling repeatable processes and effectively reducing human error(which could about as a result of natural fatigue (machines do not suffer this)). Machines use sensors to perceive their environment through technologies such as machine vision), actuators perform actions, and controllers act as the brains. These tools work in tandem with traditional power, network and safety systems to enable optimal functioning. Use cases include packagingend products at a product line, installing car doors at an auto manufacturing plant.

#### Consumer

In the consumer realm, automation primarily aims to improve user convenience such as through smart assistants controlling other connected home devices through voice. This segues smoothly into the pivotal role of automation in smart home tech that allows residents to achieve greater energy efficiency(through for example smart bulbs that dim during day) and improved security(security cameras that notify home owners of suspected intrusions, or motion sensor installed security lights that trigger an alarm on sensing movement )


### Testing Methodologies {#sec-testing-methodologies}

Effective quality assurance for automation systems follows a hierarchical testing framework commonly known as the testing pyramid. 

#| label: fig-testing-pyramid
#| fig-cap: Testing Pyramid for Automation Systems
#| fig-alt: A diagram of a testing pyramid, showing the relative proportion of different types of tests.

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Define the data for the testing pyramid
test_levels <- data.frame(
  level = c("Unit Tests", "Integration Tests", "API Tests", "UI Tests"),
  coverage = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05),
  y_position = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.55, 0.8) # Adjusted y positions for better label placement
)

# Create the testing pyramid plot
ggplot(test_levels, aes(x = 1, y = coverage, fill = level)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  labs(fill = "Testing Level") +
  # Add labels inside the pyramid slices
  geom_text(aes(y = y_position, 
                label = paste0(level, " (", round(coverage * 100), "%)")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            size = 3, color = "black") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # Hide the legend

* **Unit Tests**: Validating individual components at the code level. This tests the most granular aspect of the system - possibly at a software programs function level.
* **Integration Tests**: Verifying interactions between several combined code components or modules
* **API (Application Programming Interface) Tests**: Validating that different software components communicate and exchange data correctly and securely, could be internal to a software program or between two or more independent software programs
* **UI Tests**: Confirming proper functionality (encompassing performance, visual and functional aspects) of user interfaces

This hierrarchical testing framework ensures comprehensive validation while prioritizing the most fundamental elements, enabling detection of issues early in the development lifecycle and a modular approach towards troubleshooting potential issues [@LiveSession8].

## Task 2: AI in Computer Vision for IoT {#sec-task1-2}

### AI in Computer Vision {#sec-ai-vision}

Artificial Intelligence has positively transformed the abilities of vision systems in IoT devices by supercharging their ability to interpret and act upon visual data with never-before-seen accuracy. Using techniques such as deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), machines can now recognize patterns and objects with accuracy that is either on par with or even surpasses human capabilities. This advancement enables a wide ranging  array of practical applications such as object detection, facial recognition, defect detection amongst others. 

While speaking of equivalence with normal human sight, its is noteworthy that it is their very ability to exceed the human vision capabilites that they find their most practical and irreplaceable usecases in industry. For example in the manufacturing domain, for mission critical components such as aircraft engines, the ability to detect defects such as miniscule gaps and cracks that are invisible to the naked eye is paramount. AI-powered computer vision systems can analyze images and videos in real-time, identifying defects and anomalies with a level of precision and magnification that far exceeds human capabilities. This not only enhances product quality but also reduces the risk of costly recalls and catastrophic safety incidents.

### Industry Applications and Real World Examples{#sec-industry-applications}

AI-powered computer vision delivers transformative capabilities across multiple domains:

* **Quality Control**: Automated defect detection with classification capabilities that exceed traditional machine vision systems in both accuracy and adaptability, consider the General Electric's use of AI-powered computer vision to inspect turbine blades for defects, significantly reducing inspection time and improving accuracy [@LiveSession8]
* **Assembly Operations**: Real-time monitoring for process optimization, identifying bottlenecks and ensuring adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs). For example, Tesla's use of AI-powered computer vision to monitor assembly line operations, ensuring that each step is performed correctly and efficiently
* **Worker Safety**: Continuous monitoring for hazardous conditions and PPE compliance, enabling proactive intervention before incidents occur
* **Intelligent Video Analytics**: Advanced capabilities including object detection, behavioral analysis, and predictive insights that extend far beyond traditional video surveillance, though consider the data privacy violations implications of this usecase where data subjects have to be duly informed and have to give consent to their data being used in this manner. For example, Amazon's use of AI-powered computer vision in its Go stores to monitor customer behavior and optimize store layouts
