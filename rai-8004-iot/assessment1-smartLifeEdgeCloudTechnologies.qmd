# Introduction

## Background on smart life technologies and edge cloud computing

### Smart Life
Smart life is enabled by the intersection of the web of smart sensor embedded devices that are connected with each other and the internet **(Internet of Things) powering greater operational conveniences, increased energy efficiency, improved safety at the home. 

Take for instance a smart security light that will automatically dim itself at dawn, or send a notification to a home owner when its motion sensor is triggered by movement at night. 

### Edge Cloud Computing
As the term edge suggests, this paradigm involves placing cloud resources in close proximity to where data is generated and where end users are located. The main motivation for this architecture being reducted data latency (as data is transmitted via a shorter route) and maintaining high availability of compute resources. 

This is especially intsturmental in processing sensor data for IoT and Smart Life applications.

# Exercise 1: Smart Life Technologies 

## Task 1: Investing in Smart Life Technologies

### Raising Kids Smart, An Opporuntity for LifeX

Central to LifeX' mission is augmenting life through smart technologies. The X in LifeX points to the multiplicative potential of technology to enhance quality of life. and nowhere is this more needed than in the increasingly busy lives of middle class parents raising toddlers.

Now more than ever, owing to dire economic times both parents are working full time jobs and with more corporations rethinking their work from home policies - increasingly pushing for a return to full time office work, young middle class parents are turning to full time nannies to take care of their toddlers. 

While the human touch of a good nanny is irreplaceable, nannies may not effectively juggle playtime and keeping track of a baby's vitals by the minute. Thus parents could do with a technological intervention to actively monitor their kid's wellbeing while they are away. Enter the LifeX Smart AI Baby Monitor.

### Lifex Smart AI Baby Monitor
Lifex Smart AI Baby Monitor is a dual device system comprising of a smart camera and a smart wristband. The smart camera mountable on a standard baby crib records footage and audio of the baby while the wearable, 
monitors , in the similar fashion to smart watches, the baby's vitals - heart rate, temperature, oxygen levels,etc. The two devices stay interconnected via a low power bluetooth connection. They send a stream of multimodal data(audio, visual, text) to a hosted ai model that runs analytics on the data and presents metrics to on a dashboard accessible via an app on the parents smartphone. 
It can also integrate with existing smart assistants present in the home to send local notifications to the nanny in case of vitals metrics threshold breaches. For instance it can trigger dimming of the smart bulb in the childs room, play lullabies on the Amazon Alexa when the baby is snoozing or crying. The parent can also talk to
While the 

### Finacial Model
The Lifex Smart AI Baby Monitor starter hardware(camera and wristband) will be sold as a bundle for a one time fee of $200. Henceforth users will pay a $30 a month subscription to use the app and AI service. Partnerships with health facilities will allow LifeX to subsidize the cost for new parents with the caveat that they will allow 

## Task 2: Virtualization and Cloud Computing - Foundational Pillars of Smart Life Technologies

### Virtualization
By using software to create simulated hardware or software components, we can ensure more efficient utilization of resources used my smart life tech. Using LifeX' on prem servers as an example, using virtualization locally through VMWare would allow LifeX to run multiple instances of the Smart Baby AI monitor across different Operating Systems without having to purchase extra hardware.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing provides access to a shared pool of compute resources. By leveraging the five key characteristics of cloud computing as defined by NIST:
On-demand self-service cuts out proxies between LifeX and the compute resources provider - bolstering unfettered and immediate access 
Broad network access means connected IOT devices powering smart life tech anywhere in the world can acccess compute resources as long as they are so configured. Through resource pooling, economies of scale enter the equation allowing smaller players like LifeX to essentially afford compute. Rapid elasticity is key to flexible and instant scaling of compute needs depending on demand of resources - offloading the on prem scaling timing headache.
That cloud resources are a measured service, means services consumed are billed based on utilization of resources which supports pragmatic decision making around budgeting and pricing of products and services LifeX offfers.
In addition, As Big Tech corps retain the ascendancy of the most powerful compute hardware (e.g NVidia has dominated the GPU market for a while) , cloud computing offers smaller players in the market more affordable access to the power of High Performance Computing which they would otherwise forfeit because of the high acquisition costs.

## Task 3: Centralized AI vs. Edge AI 

### Centralized AI
The centralized AI idea involves sending data from smart devices to a central location for analysis and processing. While network intensive and bearing higher latencies, processing in the cloud has the undeniable benefit where thin smart devices with little processing power can leverage the power of more capable cloud servers. 
In the case of Lifex' AI Baby Monitor, sending its data to a centralized ai would allow the AI model to also collect data and learn from multiple monitors, resulting in a richer dataset. In terms of design it would allow a simpler design for the two part monitor hardware as it would not need to be as powerful as it would be if it were to process the data locally.

### Edge AI
Edge AI in contrast involves processing data on device or closer to where the data is generated as much as possible. In the case of our baby monitor, the wristband could be designed to send data to the monitor hardware via a low powered bluetooth connection or some form of wifi connection. The chip in the monitor would then process the data locally - with new advancements in small language models and distillation techniques (where a smaller model can learn utilizing the outputs of a larger model) it is possible to run a 1-2B parameter model on device ) and send only the more critical data to the cloud for further processing. This would reduce the amount of data sent to the cloud saving on bandwidth and reduce the latency of the system. Additionally containing the data on device enhances the overall security of a system so vitally in need of privacy as a baby monitor.
