# AI Strategy for Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation

## Executive Summary

The Pharo Foundation, encompassing both Pharo Development (non-profit) and Pharo Ventures (for-profit), is dedicated to fostering self-sufficiency in Africa through education, water management, and productivity enhancement. As the organization advances its finance transformation strategy to enhance financial management and operational efficiency, artificial intelligence (AI) presents significant opportunities to accelerate and deepen this transformation.

This AI strategy proposes a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into Pharo Foundation's finance functions, with an emphasis on the 3Rs framework: Replace manual processes, Reimagine operations, and Recombine existing systems. Key initiatives include implementing a unified financial intelligence platform, intelligent process automation, predictive analytics, compliance and risk management tools, and a financial decision support system.

By implementing this AI strategy, Pharo Foundation can expect enhanced operational efficiency across both Development and Ventures arms, improved collaboration across countries of operation, strengthened financial controls, and enhanced decision-making capabilities. Implementation will follow a three-phase approach over 36 months, requiring investments in technology infrastructure, talent development, and organizational change management.

For successful implementation, the Foundation must address data quality challenges, connectivity issues in African regions, and skill gaps while ensuring AI applications align with the organization's mission of fostering self-reliance in Africa. With thoughtful implementation, AI can become a powerful enabler of Pharo Foundation's vision of "a vibrant, productive, and self-reliant Africa."

## Introduction

Pharo Foundation operates through two main arms: Pharo Development, focusing on public goods and not-for-profit projects, and Pharo Ventures, investing in private sector and for-profit ventures. Both arms work toward achieving Pharo's missions but utilize different tools and approaches (Pharo Foundation, 2023). This dual structure creates unique financial management challenges that must be addressed through a comprehensive transformation strategy.

The Foundation has recently embarked on a finance transformation journey, moving from Xero and Approvalmax to Microsoft Dynamics Business Central (BC) as its enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This migration aims to modernize financial systems, streamline financial processes, and enhance financial data management to improve decision-making and operational efficiency (Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation Strategy, 2024). However, implementing BC has faced challenges, including user adaptation issues and inconsistent workflows across countries of operation.

Artificial intelligence presents a significant opportunity to enhance this finance transformation. As Castelo et al. (2019) note, "AI is on the verge of reshaping the future of business operations, with the market for AI in transportation projected to reach $10.3 billion by 2030." In finance specifically, AI can automate routine tasks, enhance decision-making with data-driven insights, improve compliance monitoring, and optimize resource allocation (Jung & Seiter, 2021).

This AI strategy outlines how Pharo Foundation can leverage AI technologies to accelerate and enhance its finance transformation, supporting both arms in achieving their missions more effectively. The strategy aligns with Pharo's vision of "a vibrant, productive, and self-reliant Africa" by enabling more efficient, transparent, and data-driven financial operations that will ultimately strengthen the Foundation's impact across its education, water, and productivity missions.

## AI Strategy

### Strategic Business Objectives

The AI strategy for Pharo Foundation's finance transformation is designed to support the organization's vision of "a vibrant, productive, and self-reliant Africa" by enhancing financial operations across both Pharo Development and Pharo Ventures. This strategy directly supports Pharo's three core missions:

1. **Education Mission**: By optimizing financial resources and improving resource allocation decisions, AI will help the Foundation maximize the impact of its educational initiatives, from early childhood education to vocational training.

2. **Water Mission**: AI-enhanced financial planning will improve cost-effectiveness and sustainability of water infrastructure projects, ensuring communities across Africa have access to safe and affordable water sources.

3. **Productivity Mission**: Through better financial analytics and decision support, the Foundation can more effectively eliminate barriers to employment and productivity for working people.

At the operational level, the AI strategy aims to enhance the finance transformation by:
- Modernizing financial systems through intelligent automation and advanced analytics
- Streamlining financial processes through AI-powered workflow optimization
- Enhancing financial data management with improved data integration and quality controls
- Improving decision-making through predictive analytics and scenario modeling
- Maintaining strong controls and visibility through AI-enhanced risk management

As Brynjolfsson and Mitchell (2017) observe, "AI is driven by data. To fully leverage the value of AI at an enterprise level, organizations should focus on their proprietary information and treat it as a high-value, critical asset." For Pharo Foundation, this means leveraging its unique financial and operational data across multiple countries to generate insights that drive mission impact.

### Strategic AI Frameworks Application: The 3Rs Model

To structure the AI transformation of Pharo Foundation's finance function, we apply the 3Rs model: Replace, Reimagine, and Recombine (Iansiti & Lakhani, 2020). This framework provides a systematic approach to identify opportunities for AI implementation across the finance function.

#### Replace: Automating Manual Financial Processes

The first dimension of transformation involves identifying routine, manual processes that can be automated through AI:

- **Financial Document Processing**: AI can extract data from invoices, receipts, and financial documents through optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP), eliminating manual data entry. This is particularly valuable for Pharo Foundation's operations across multiple African countries, where document standards may vary.

- **Transaction Categorization**: ML algorithms can automatically categorize financial transactions based on historical patterns, reducing manual classification work and improving consistency. This addresses the current challenge of maintaining consistent financial records across Development and Ventures arms.

- **Basic Reporting and Reconciliation**: AI can automate the generation of standard financial reports and perform preliminary reconciliation of accounts, freeing finance staff to focus on analysis and strategic tasks. This directly supports the objective to "streamline and standardize processes to eliminate bottlenecks, improve efficiency and maximize controls" (Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation Strategy, 2024).

#### Reimagine: Transforming Financial Operations

The second dimension involves fundamentally rethinking how financial work is performed:

- **Proactive Financial Risk Management**: Rather than reactive monitoring, AI can continuously analyze financial data to identify potential risks before they materialize, enabling proactive mitigation. As noted by Maedche et al. (2019), "AI-powered risk management can transform how organizations identify, assess, and mitigate financial risks."

- **Intelligent Financial Forecasting**: Moving beyond traditional forecasting methods, AI can analyze multiple internal and external data sources to generate more accurate predictions about financial performance and resource requirements. This addresses the Foundation's need for "data-driven decision-making" and "utilizing financial data analytics for insights and informed decisions" (Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation Strategy, 2024).

- **Cross-Entity Financial Insights**: AI can break down silos between Pharo Development and Pharo Ventures, identifying patterns and relationships that would be difficult to discover manually. This directly supports the objective to develop "a unified financial system that integrates data from both non-profit and for-profit operations" (Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation Strategy, 2024).

#### Recombine: Enhancing Existing Systems

The third dimension focuses on integrating AI with existing systems to enhance their capabilities:

- **AI-Enhanced Cloud Infrastructure**: Adding AI capabilities to the Foundation's cloud-based systems (Microsoft 365 and Google Suite) can improve data management, security, and accessibility. This aligns with the infrastructure modernization goal to "upgrade financial IT infrastructure to cloud-based systems for scalability and accessibility" (Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation Strategy, 2024).

- **Intelligent Connectors Between Systems**: AI can facilitate seamless data flow between the Foundation's various systems, including the new Microsoft Dynamics Business Central ERP, HRIS, EMIS, MES, and LMS/HIMS. As Collins et al. (2021) note, "AI can significantly enhance system integration by intelligently mapping data across disparate systems."

- **Data-Driven Process Orchestration**: AI can optimize end-to-end financial processes by analyzing process performance data and recommending improvements, supporting the Foundation's goal of "continuous improvement" with "regular reviews and refinements" (Pharo Foundation Finance Transformation Strategy, 2024).

## Challenges and Ethical Considerations

Implementing AI in Pharo Foundation's finance function presents unique challenges given the organization's dual structure and multi-country operations in Africa. These challenges must be addressed proactively to ensure successful implementation and alignment with the Foundation's values.

### Implementation Challenges

#### Data Quality and Integration Issues

Data challenges are particularly acute in the African context, where digital infrastructure may be limited:

- **Addressing Data Silos**: Pharo Development and Pharo Ventures currently operate with separate systems and data stores. As noted in the finance transformation strategy, creating "a unified financial system that integrates data from both non-profit and for-profit operations" is a key objective but presents significant technical challenges.

- **Standardizing Data Across Countries**: The Foundation operates across multiple African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Somaliland), each with different financial systems and practices. Creating standardized data definitions and formats across these contexts will require significant effort.

- **Implementing Robust Data Governance**: According to Barros Pena et al. (2021), "Organizations implementing AI in emerging markets face significantly greater data governance challenges than those in developed economies." The Foundation will need to develop data governance frameworks that work across its diverse operational contexts.

To address these challenges, the AI strategy must include strong data governance components and phased implementation that prioritizes data quality improvement. As Thurman et al. (2019) note, "Without quality data, even the most sophisticated AI models will deliver limited value."

#### Change Management Hurdles

Cultural and organizational factors present significant challenges:

- **Managing Transition from Manual to AI-Assisted Processes**: The finance transformation notes highlight that "legacy workflows are hard to let go of" and users are "creatures of habit." Helping finance staff adapt to AI-enhanced workflows will require dedicated change management.

- **Building AI Literacy Across Diverse Teams**: There is a "finance knowledge gap between Kenya and other regions (Ethiopia, Rwanda and especially Somaliland)" noted in the finance transformation documentation. This disparity will need to be addressed through tailored training programs.

- **Ensuring User Acceptance and Engagement**: According to Edmondson (2019), psychological safety is essential for successful technology adoption. The Foundation must create an environment where finance staff feel safe experimenting with new AI tools.

Successful adoption will require a comprehensive change management strategy that includes clear communication, targeted training, and visible leadership support. As Florida (2012) suggests, "Today's knowledge workers cannot simply be ordered to adopt new technologies; they must be motivated to engage."

#### Technical Challenges

Implementing AI in African contexts presents specific technical challenges:

- **Connectivity Issues**: Many of the Foundation's operations are in areas with limited internet connectivity, which can impact cloud-based AI systems. Solutions must be designed with these constraints in mind.

- **Integration with Existing Systems**: The recent migration to Microsoft Dynamics Business Central presents both an opportunity and a challenge. As noted in the finance transformation notes, there are "no clear incompany data strategy" and "users [are] unsure of new requisition workflow."

- **Ensuring Solution Scalability and Reliability**: AI solutions must be designed to scale across the Foundation's operations while maintaining reliability in varied technical environments.

These technical challenges require careful planning and potentially hybrid approaches that combine cloud and edge computing technologies. As noted by Jung and Seiter (2021), "AI implementations in emerging markets often require adaptation of standard approaches to account for infrastructure limitations."

### Ethical Implications

Implementing AI in finance also raises important ethical considerations that align with Pharo Foundation's values of integrity, excellence, and impact:

#### Fairness and Bias Considerations

- **Ensuring Cultural Appropriateness**: AI models must be evaluated for cultural appropriateness across the different African contexts where Pharo operates. Models trained primarily on Western data may not perform equally well in African contexts.

- **Addressing Potential Biases**: According to Shin (2022b), "AI models can perpetuate existing biases in financial decision-making if not carefully designed and monitored." The Foundation must implement bias detection and mitigation strategies.

- **Equitable Application**: AI benefits should be distributed equitably across Pharo's operations, ensuring that technology does not exacerbate existing inequalities between regions or between Development and Ventures arms.

These considerations require ongoing monitoring and adjustment of AI systems to ensure they support the Foundation's mission of fostering self-reliance across Africa.

#### Accountability Frameworks

- **Clear Responsibility Structures**: The Foundation must establish clear accountability for AI decisions, particularly those related to financial resource allocation or risk assessment.

- **Oversight Mechanisms**: Implementing governance structures that provide appropriate oversight of AI systems while maintaining operational efficiency.

- **Audit Procedures**: Developing procedures for regular auditing of AI systems to ensure they operate as intended and align with organizational values.

Shin et al. (2022) emphasize that "algorithmic transparency and accountability are especially important in contexts where technology adoption may outpace regulatory frameworks." This is particularly relevant in the African countries where Pharo operates.

#### Societal Impact

- **Effect on Workforce Roles and Skills**: AI implementation will change the nature of finance roles at Pharo Foundation. According to McKinsey (2023), "AI in finance functions typically shifts roles from transaction processing to analysis and decision support."

- **Alignment with Mission of Self-Reliance**: All AI implementations should ultimately support Pharo's mission of fostering self-reliance in Africa, ensuring technology builds rather than replaces local capacity.

- **Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals**: AI applications should be evaluated for their contribution to sustainable development in the regions where Pharo operates.

As Pharo Foundation aims to create "a vibrant, productive, and self-reliant Africa," AI implementation must be thoughtfully designed to enhance rather than diminish human capabilities. As noted by Longoni et al. (2019), "Technology implementations are most successful when they augment rather than replace human judgment and expertise."

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Pharo Foundation stands at a pivotal moment in its finance transformation journey, with artificial intelligence offering powerful capabilities to enhance efficiency, improve decision-making, and strengthen governance. By strategically implementing AI across its finance functions, the Foundation can better support its mission of fostering a "vibrant, productive, and self-reliant Africa."

### Key Strategic Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Data Foundation**: Before implementing advanced AI capabilities, ensure the Foundation has strong data governance, quality processes, and integration architecture. As noted by Shin (2022a), "The quality of AI outputs is directly dependent on the quality of data inputs."

2. **Take a Phased Approach**: Follow the three-phase implementation roadmap, starting with high-value, low-complexity use cases like document processing automation before progressing to more sophisticated applications. This approach aligns with best practices identified by Bloedorn et al. (2023) in the MITRE AI Maturity Model.

3. **Invest in People**: Complement technology investments with comprehensive training and change management to build AI literacy across the finance function. As Deci and Flaste (1995) emphasize, intrinsic motivation is essential for successful technology adoption.

4. **Ensure Cross-Entity Integration**: Design AI solutions that bridge Pharo Development and Pharo Ventures, supporting the Foundation's goal of a unified financial system that enables seamless data flow and coordination across entities, business units, and countries.

5. **Embed Ethical Considerations**: Integrate fairness, accountability, and alignment with Pharo's mission into all AI implementations, ensuring technology enhances rather than undermines the Foundation's values and goals.

### Critical Success Factors

For successful AI implementation, the Foundation should focus on these critical factors:

- **Executive Sponsorship**: Active support from the CFO and Global Finance Lead to drive change and remove barriers
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Close partnership between finance, IT, and program teams
- **User-Centered Design**: Development of AI solutions with continuous input from finance staff
- **Robust Governance**: Clear structures for decision-making, risk management, and ethical oversight
- **Continuous Learning**: Mechanisms to capture lessons learned and improve implementation approaches

### Long-term Vision

By successfully implementing this AI strategy, Pharo Foundation can transform its finance function from a transaction-processing and reporting center to a strategic partner that provides data-driven insights to drive mission impact. AI-enhanced finance capabilities will support more efficient resource allocation, stronger risk management, and ultimately greater impact across Pharo's education, water, and productivity missions.

As the Foundation works to foster self-reliance in Africa, AI can serve as a powerful enabler, helping to optimize the use of resources, improve transparency, and strengthen decision-making. With thoughtful implementation that balances technological innovation with organizational and ethical considerations, Pharo Foundation can leverage AI to amplify its contribution to sustainable development across Africa.
