# Introduction

## Background on smart life technologies and edge cloud computing

### Smart Life
Smart life is enabled by the intersection of the web of smart sensor embedded devices that are connected with each other and the internet **(Internet of Things) powering greater operational conveniences, increased energy efficiency, improved safety at the home. 

Take for instance a smart security light that will automatically dim itself at dawn, or send a notification to a home owner when its motion sensor is triggered by movement at night. 

### Edge Cloud Computing
As the term edge suggests, this paradigm involves placing cloud resources in close proximity to where data is generated and where end users are located. The main motivation for this architecture being reducted data latency (as data is transmitted via a shorter route) and maintaining high availability of compute resources. 

This is especially intsturmental in processing sensor data for IoT and Smart Life applications.
