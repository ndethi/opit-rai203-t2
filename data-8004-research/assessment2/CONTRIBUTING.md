# Contributing to AI vs. Human Email Professionalism Research Project

Thank you for considering contributing to this collaborative research project. We welcome your ideas, bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) page to report bugs or request new features.
- Provide a clear and descriptive title, including steps to reproduce issues if applicable.
- Label your issue appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation).

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account and clone it locally.

2. **Create a New Branch:**  
   Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-or-bugfix
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes:**  
   - Follow the established coding styles:
     - For R code, follow tidyverse style guidelines.
     - For Quarto Markdown documents, maintain consistency with the YAML header and document structure.
   - Ensure that your changes do not conflict with existing formatting, especially for email samples and visualization code.

4. **Write Clear Commit Messages with Commitizen:**  
   We use [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) to generate standardized commit messages.
   - If you haven't yet, install Commitizen globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g commitizen
     ```
   - To initialize Commitizen in the repository (if not already set up), run:
     ```bash
     commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
     ```
   - When committing your changes, use:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git cz
     ```
   This will prompt you to select a commit type and fill in a commit message that follows the conventional changelog standard.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**  
   - Push your branch to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-or-bugfix
     ```
   - Open a PR against the main repository branch and reference any related issues.

## Code and Documentation Standards

- **YAML & LaTeX:**  
  Adhere to the document setup in the YAML header, ensuring margins, typography, and custom styling are maintained.

- **R Package Integration:**  
  Ensure any new code or dependencies (e.g., additional R packages) are documented in both the code and the repository setup instructions.  
  If needed, include installation instructions, for example:
  ```r
  install.packages("ggplot2")
  install.packages("dplyr")
  install.packages("tidyr")
  ```

- **Documentation:**  
  Update the README, CHANGELOG, or relevant documentation if your changes affect the projectâ€™s functionality or setup.

- **Testing & Rendering:**  
  Verify your changes by rendering the Quarto document:
  ```bash
  quarto render <your-document>.qmd
  ```

## Environment Setup

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- R with required packages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)
- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live on WSL) for PDF rendering
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (for Commitizen)
- **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** or **Microsoft Visual Studio** (your preferred development environment)
- **GitHub Copilot** for enhanced code editing support
