# Introduction

## Background on smart life technologies and edge cloud computing

### Smart Life
Smart life is enabled by the intersection of the web of smart sensor embedded devices that are connected with each other and the internet **(Internet of Things) powering greater operational conveniences, increased energy efficiency, improved safety at the home. 

Take for instance a smart security light that will automatically dim itself at dawn, or send a notification to a home owner when its motion sensor is triggered by movement at night. 

### Edge Cloud Computing
As the term edge suggests, this paradigm involves placing cloud resources in close proximity to where data is generated and where end users are located. The main motivation for this architecture being reducted data latency (as data is transmitted via a shorter route) and maintaining high availability of compute resources. 

This is especially intsturmental in processing sensor data for IoT and Smart Life applications.

## Task 1: Investing in Smart Life Technologies

### Raising Kids Smart, An Opporuntity for LifeX

Central to LifeX' mission is augmenting life through smart technologies. The X in LifeX points to the multiplicative potential of technology to enhance quality of life. and nowhere is this more needed than in the increasingly busy lives of middle class parents raising toddlers.

Now more than ever, owing to dire economic times both parents are working full time jobs and with more corporations rethinking their work from home policies - increasingly pushing for a return to full time office work, young middle class parents are turning to full time nannies to take care of their toddlers. 

While the human touch of a good nanny is irreplaceable, nannies may not effectively juggle playtime and keeping track of a baby's vitals by the minute. Thus parents could do with a technological intervention to actively monitor their kid's wellbeing while they are away. Enter the LifeX Smart AI Baby Monitor
